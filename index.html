<p>As a kid, I have always been interested in technology. I loved figuring out how technology functioned and how to fix them. I have always love working with cool gadgets, including building my own home entertainment systems with raspberry pi and controlling my home with my android phone through tasker. putting my own computers together. The moment when I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in software development was in my freshmen year of college. During my search to find what I wanted to do
for the rest of my life, I took an Intro to Java class. Dr. Bailey was a very experienced and successful software programmer. He was one of those old school programmers that started programming before I was born. He would later become my most respected professor and inspired me to switch my major to computer science.</p>
