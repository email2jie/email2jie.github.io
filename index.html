<a id="About Me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>
<p>Here are some qualities that I believe are part of me, but definitely does not completely define me. I believe in working smart not hard, but I am just as ready to roll my sleeves up and dig in if needed. I strive to be an accountable person. I believe that I should be living a life that I can be proud of and that my son can look up to me. This means that whatever action I do and say has consequences. I will always own my mistakes and take responsibility for my code. 

From my one and half year as a full stack engineer at Firefly Dimension, Inc. this is what I have learned about myself. I am a quick learner. I had to adapt on multiple occasions to the need of the company. As the only software engineer at this company, I had to self learn Unity with zero game development experience. Then rolling out full stack AR demos going from low-level DLLs to UDP and TCP transfers to high-level multiplayer implementations. I delivered multiple full stack demos with many functionalities in each. I believe in underestimating and over delivering. I was able to deliver new features at less than half of the agreed projected time. In our start-up environment, it was very exciting to deliver 3-5 features in a week. 

The most important thing learned during my time at Firefly Dimension is that I belong in this field. My love for coding and solving problems is ever strong. I loved every single day of my job. There was, of course, countless days of frustration when bugs could not be solved, but the feeling when it does eventually get solved just makes it all worth it. </p>
